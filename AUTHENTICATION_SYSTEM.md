### **Features Added:**
- ‚úÖ Role-based authentication
- ‚úÖ Collector authorization verification  
- ‚úÖ Fixed 3-point reward system
- ‚úÖ Simplified scanning interface
- ‚úÖ Automatic point transfer

## üéØ **User Interface Updates**

### **Login Screen:**
- Role selection dropdown (User/Collector)
- Authorization warning for collector access
- Demo credentials for easy testing
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### **Bottom Navigation:**
- Dynamic navigation based on user role
- Collector-specific tabs when logged in as collector
- User-specific tabs when logged in as regular user

### **Profile Page:**
- Displays user role and authorization status

## üîÑ **System Workflow**

### **For Regular Users:**

2. Generate QR codes for waste bags
3. Print and attach QR codes to bags
4. Wait for collector to scan and award points

### **For Authorized Collectors:**
1. Login with collector credentials (must be community-authorized)
2. Access simplified collector dashboard
3. Visually verify waste segregation
4. Scan QR codes on properly segregated bags
5. System automatically awards 3 points per bag
6. Complete collection and move to next location

## üöÄ **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/auth.js` - Authentication service with role validation
- `components/EnhancedLoginForm.jsx` - New login form with role selection
- `components/pages/SimplifiedCollectorDashboard.jsx` - Streamlined collector interface
- Updated existing components for role-based access

### **Key Security Features:**
- Role-based authentication
- Community authorization verification
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access
- Session management with localStorage

## üì± **How to Test**

1. **Start the application:** `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Try different demo accounts** to see role-based access
4. **Test collector authorization** with authorized vs unauthorized accounts
5. **Experience simplified QR scanning** with fixed 3-point rewards

The system now provides a secure, role-based authentication system where only community-authorized collectors can access collector features, and the scanning process is simplified to award a fixed 3 points per bag without manual segregation steps.
